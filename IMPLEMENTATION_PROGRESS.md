# Political Conversion Implementation Progress

## âœ… Phase 1: Database Schema Changes (COMPLETED)

### Enhanced Schema
- **New Enums**: Added political enums for post types, priority levels, governance levels, post status, and reaction types
- **Posts Table**: Converted `topic` table to `post` table with political fields:
  - `postType`: 'issue', 'feedback', 'suggestion'
  - `priorityLevel`: 'low', 'medium', 'high'
  - `governanceLevel`: 'national', 'state', 'local'
  - `status`: 'open', 'in_review', 'acknowledged', 'resolved', 'rejected'
  - `location`: For state/local level posts
  - `deadline`: For time-sensitive posts
  - `officialResponse`: Government official responses

### New Tables
- **officialTag**: Government officials management with verification
- **postTag**: Tagging system linking posts to officials
- **attachment**: File upload system for documents/images
- **reaction**: Enhanced reaction system beyond upvote/downvote
- **notification**: Notification system for political engagement

### Migration
- Generated migration file `0001_foamy_hex.sql` with all schema changes
- Properly renamed `topic` to `post` and updated foreign key references

## âœ… Phase 2: Backend API Changes (COMPLETED)

### New API Structure
```
/api/posts/                   # Enhanced posts API
â”œâ”€â”€ route.ts                  # CRUD with political filtering
â”œâ”€â”€ [id]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ route.ts             # Individual post operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ comments/route.ts    # Updated for posts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reactions/route.ts   # New enhanced reaction system

/api/officials/              # Government officials management
â””â”€â”€ route.ts                # CRUD for official tags

/api/tags/                   # Political tagging system
â””â”€â”€ route.ts                # Tag management for posts
```

### Enhanced Features
- **Political Filtering**: Filter by post type, priority, governance level, status, location
- **Government Official Integration**: Create and manage official tags
- **Enhanced Reactions**: Multiple reaction types beyond voting
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for political fields

## âœ… Phase 3: Frontend Components (IN PROGRESS)

### New Political Components

- **PrioritySelector**: Choose priority levels with visual indicators
- **GovernanceLevelSelector**: Select national, state, or local governance
- **StatusBadge**: Display post status with appropriate styling
- **LocationSelector**: Location input for state/local posts

### Enhanced Post Components
- **PostCard**: Redesigned with political metadata display
- **PostFilters**: Advanced filtering interface for political posts

### Political Features in PostCard
- Post type icons and labels
- Priority level visual indicators
- Governance level display with location
- Status badges
- Official response highlighting
- Deadline warnings for urgent posts

## ðŸš§ Next Steps

## Technical Notes

### Database Migration Required
- The schema changes are ready but migration needs to be executed
- Existing topic data will need to be migrated to post format
- Default values will be assigned for new political fields

### Component Integration
- All new components use the existing design system
- Maintaining backward compatibility where possible
- Enhanced user experience with political-focused UI

### API Compatibility
- New APIs are implemented alongside existing ones
- Gradual migration approach to minimize disruption
- Enhanced filtering and search capabilities

## Key Achievements

1. **Complete database transformation** from topic-based to political post system
2. **Comprehensive API layer** with political filtering and management
3. **Political-focused UI components** with government integration
4. **Enhanced user experience** for civic engagement
5. **Scalable architecture** for future political features

The foundation for the political platform is now established. The next phase will focus on completing the frontend components and updating the main application pages to use the new political system.
